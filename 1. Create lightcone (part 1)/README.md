The notebook "MAMBO+AGN.ipynb" is used to read a dark matter(DM) lightcone, and populate the DM halos with galaxies and AGN.
Some physical properties (such as stellar mass and X-ray luminosity of AGN) are assigned in this step, while the rest of the physical
properties and the observables (magnitudes and SEDs) will be assigned on the next step.


All the necessary files to run this notebook can be downloaded from this public Google Drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1CQN3V1aWbMQ10iu5-OfnQ8P7JIpcPhtf). The notebook should be downloaded and run in that same folder.
