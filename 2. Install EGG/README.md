## 2.- Assign physical properties and observables

The Empirical Galaxy Generator (EGG) is a set of tools to generate mock galaxy catalogs and images with realistic positions,
morphologies and fluxes from the far-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. The code can be downloaded and installed following the
instructions on the [EGG repository](https://github.com/cschreib/egg). The code was originally written by Corentin Schreiber.

As part of the MAMBO workflow, we modified the code EGG to handle AGN (among other modifications). To our the modified EGG version,
one should download the original EGG and change the contents of the directory "egg-master/src" by the one in the folder "src (modified)"
provided in this repository.
