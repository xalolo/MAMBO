In this [Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10MMx0sJg3kFaVBqn-iNB_Vu1u3eaehUn?usp=sharing) you will find

  - The full catalogue containing ~8e6 sources (galaxies + AGN), separated into 10 different files (due to the big size of the files), which are named 'MAMBO_AGN+gals_Millenium_lc23_z[z_min]_[z_max].fits'. Each file contains only sources in the redshift range z_min < z < z_max.
  - A 'README.txt' file, explaining all the columns of the catalogue.
  - The folder SEDs, which contains the SEDs of certain sources (see the README.txt).
  - The file 'df_SEDs_fromEGG_out_col.fits', which is the catalogue containing all the physical properties for the objects for which there is an SED available.
  - The notebook 'Read_catalogue.ipynb', which allows you to visualize the data within the catalogue. To run this notebook online without downloading all of the files, you need to create
a shortcut into your 'MyDrive' folder. If you create the shortcut into another path, you will need to modify the line *HOMEDIR = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Millennium_MAMBO/'*.
