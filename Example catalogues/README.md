In each folder, you can find examples of catalogues generated with MAMBO, as well as the generated SEDs for some of the objects.

The folder [**Millennium**](https://github.com/xalolo/MAMBO/tree/main/Example%20catalogues/Millennium) contains a catalogue created starting from a DM lightcone built by Henriques et al. (2015) on the Millennium Simulation. The lightcone covers an area of 3.14 deg<sup>2</sup>, with a total redshift range of z = [0, 10]
