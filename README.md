MAMBO (Mocks with Abundance Matching in BOlogna) is a workflow designed to construct an empirical mock catalogue of
galaxies and AGN which can reproduce with accuracy their physical properties and observables, such as rest-frame and observed magnitudes
and spectral features. For a schematic representation of the workflow, see the flowchart at the bottom of this page. For a detailed description, see [López-López et al.](link_to_paper).



# How to create a mock catalogue with MAMBO
This repository provides all the necessary code and inputs to create a galaxy and AGN mock catalogue starting from a DM lightcone. For this,
one must follow the instructions given in sections [DM to galaxies](https://github.com/xalolo/MAMBO/tree/main/1.%20Create%20lightcone%20(part%201)) and 
[2. Install EGG](https://github.com/xalolo/MAMBO/tree/main/2.%20Install%20EGG).

# Download and explore and existing catalogue
If you wish to download an already existing catalogue, you can find examples in [Example catalogues](https://github.com/xalolo/MAMBO/tree/main/Example%20catalogues)
