<h1 align="center">MAMBO: Mocks with Abundance Matching in BOlogna</h1>

MAMBO (Mocks with Abundance Matching in BOlogna) is a workflow designed to construct an empirical mock catalogue of
galaxies and AGN which can reproduce with accuracy their physical properties and observables, such as rest-frame and observed magnitudes
and spectral features.

# How to create a mock catalogue with MAMBO

## 1.- Populate DM lightcone with galaxies and AGN

## 2.- Assign physical properties and observables
